      (1) - <a href="/">root - verbs conjugations </a></br>
      (2) - <a href="/stuff2.html">nouns: articles and endings</a></br>
      (3) - <a href="/help.html">this page</a></br>

    <li>Disclaimer: ATTENTION ! Sentences and verb conjugations are generated by chatGPT, it's very possible that there can be mistakes, I did review some of them thourougly, some - not so much.</li>
    <li>Match can be done on a full sentence or on verb only (see "Type only verb" checkbox).</li>
    <li>Accent marks are important for matching</li>
    <li>Matching is case-insensitive</li>
    <li>After the match is successfull and input field turns green, either press 'Enter' or press 'Next example' button</li>
    <li>Greek question-mark (;) is not matched, you can ignore it completely (because it's hard to type it on mobile keyboard)</li>
    <li>Refreshing the page will cause all state to be reset ( selected checkboxes, already passed examples )</li>
    <li>Sometimes it can be hard to understand what tense is used in the sentence. If the match doesn't happen - try another tense that kind-of makes sense :shrug:</li>
    <li>In 'articles' example "την σοκολάτα" - ν in την is not removed deliberately to memorise the 'την' itself. Though correct form is 'τη σοκολάτα' because 'ν' on the end is removed in this case.</li>
