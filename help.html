    <li>Disclaimer: ATTENTION ! Sentences and verb conjugations are generated by chatGPT, it's very possible that there can be mistakes, Some of them I review thourougly, some - not yet.</li>
    <li>Match is done on a full sentence, not verb only.</li>
    <li>Accent marks are important for matching</li>
    <li>Matching is case-insensitive</li>
    <li>Greek question-mark (;) is not matched, you can ignore it completely (because it's hard to type it on mobile keyboard)</li>
    <li>Refreshing the page will cause all state to be reset ( selected checkboxes, already passed examples )</li>
    <li>Sometimes it can be hard to understand what tense is used in the sentence. If the match doesn't happen - try another tense that kind-of makes sense :shrug:</li>
    <li style="text-decoration: line-through">Pressing 'Enter' refreshes the page, so ... don't do it [This will be fixed in the future probably..] The match happens once contents of the text-field match the needed sentence, so no 'Enter' press is needed</li>
